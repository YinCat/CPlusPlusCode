In fact, backtracking algorithm is an enumeration-like search attempt process, mainly in the search attempt process to find the solution of the problem, when it is found that the solution conditions are not satisfied, it "backtracks" back to try other paths. Backtracking is an optimal search method, which searches forward according to the optimal conditions to achieve the goal. But when a certain step is explored, it is found that the original choice is not optimal or can not reach the goal, so it is back to one step to re-select. This technique is called backtracking method, and the point satisfying a certain state of backtracking condition is called "backtracking point".
Backtracking is also used in this problem, that is, the point coordinates that go through the stack, when there is no way to go, it begins to go back, that is, out of the stack!
